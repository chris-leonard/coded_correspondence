# Coded Correspondence

This off-platform project is oriented around string methods. The .ipynb file from Codecademy provides instructions that take you through defining functions to decode and encode messages using the Caesar and Vigenere ciphers. I have completed the exercises and added functionality to deal with messages that involve both upper- and lower-case letters.
